# AI Template Usage Checklist

> Repository creation workflow: When the user provides a Git URL, treat that repository as an inspiration/source repository. Do not clone it as the working project and do not preserve its history. Create a brand-new repository whose name matches the project name, copy the files from the inspiration repository's current `HEAD` into the new repository, and make exactly one commit named `Initial Commit`. At the end of this checklist, the local project must be a checkout of the new repository with that new repository configured as `origin`; do not publish project-specific work to the template or inspiration repository.

> IMPORTANT: This checklist is completed in the new project repository created from this template. Do not commit project-specific changes to `github-repository-template`. First create a separate repository whose name matches the project name, then perform the checklist and commit the work there.

Use this checklist when creating a project from this repository. Make choices
from the new project's actual needs. This repository includes a small
Node/npm/Vite baseline that may be retained or replaced deliberately.

## 1. Confirm the request

- [ ] Follow the template-use workflow in `AGENTS.md` and record whether this
      repository is being used to create a new project or as reference-only
      inspiration.
- [ ] Confirm the project's purpose, target platforms, selected stack,
      deployment target, dependency policy, and whether an OpenSpec workflow is
      required. Do not invent an unresolved input.

## 2. Establish the project

- [ ] Create a brand-new repository named for the confirmed project, based on
      this codebase's current `HEAD`. Copy its tracked files, including tracked
      dotfiles, without copying `.git`, commit history, branches, or tags. Do not
      fork this repository or use a clone of it as the new working project.
- [ ] Initialize fresh Git history in the new project and create exactly one
      commit with the exact message `Initial Commit`. Create the destination
      GitHub repository empty, without an automatically generated README,
      license, or `.gitignore` commit, and configure it as `origin` before
      pushing the initial snapshot.
- [ ] Verify the new repository starts with one commit:
      `git rev-list --count HEAD` must return `1`, and
      `git log -1 --format=%B` must return
      `Initial Commit`. Confirm `origin` points to the new project repository
      before continuing with project-specific changes.
- [ ] Rename `project-name/`, update the Vite `root` setting, and replace every
      `{project-name}`, `{github-owner}`, and `{repository-name}` placeholder
      with confirmed project metadata before adding project-specific
      implementation.
- [ ] Rename the README H1 (`# {project-name}`) to the confirmed project name.
- [ ] Replace the README introduction placeholder (`This is the project
      repo....`) with a concise summary from implemented behavior.
- [ ] Set the new GitHub repository's About description to a concise summary
      of the project's purpose and implemented behavior, consistent with its
      README.
- [ ] Set GitHub topics dynamically from the project's actual purpose,
      technologies, target platforms, and implemented features. Select relevant
      topics for each project and remove inherited template topics that do not
      apply; do not use a fixed topic list or advertise planned capabilities.
- [ ] Always set the GitHub About website URL to
      `https://www.samuelasherrivello.com/` (www.SamuelAsherRivello.com/).
      Keep the project's live demo URL in the README's Live Demo section.
- [ ] Replace the README getting-started placeholder (`This is the getting
      started...`) with accurate setup requirements and first-run guidance.
- [ ] Replace the README project-details placeholder (`This is the project
      details...`) with verified project-specific architecture, source layout,
      and workflow details.
- [ ] Remove or replace placeholder images, demo links, commands, packages, and
      release instructions.
- [ ] Keep the baseline package files at the repository root and application
      source, tests, and assets under the chosen application directory, as
      described in `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Preserve or deliberately adapt the HTML template corner roles from
      `AGENTS.md`: upper-left project title, upper-right project links,
      lower-right project version, and lower-left project settings.

## 3. Choose the technical baseline

- [ ] Add only the runtime, package manager, and dependencies required by the
      project.
- [ ] Record actual setup, run, test, build, and formatting commands in the
      README.
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` for generated outputs, local state, and secrets; keep
      the baseline `node_modules/` and `project-name/dist/` exclusions if
      Node/Vite remains.
- [ ] Add a safe `.env.example` only if the project requires configuration; it
      must contain no real credentials.

## 4. Define quality evidence

- [ ] Add focused automated checks appropriate to the chosen stack.
- [ ] For user-visible work, verify the rendered result in its real runtime or
      browser and capture only current, representative screenshots.
- [ ] Keep temporary test outputs ignored; store the canonical README image in
      the project's documentation directory.
- [ ] Document any manual verification that cannot be automated.

## 5. Configure OpenSpec

- [ ] When an OpenSpec workflow is required, generate `.agents/skills/openspec-*` files in the resulting project using OpenSpec 1.13.1. This template preserves only `.openspec-target`; do not hand-edit generated skill files.
- [ ] Verify `openspec --version` reports 1.13.1. If the CLI is missing or a
      different version, install `@fission-ai/openspec@1.13.1` following the
      [official installation guide](https://openspec.dev/docs/installation).
- [ ] Run `openspec doctor --json`, confirm `.agents/skills/.openspec-target`
      contains `codex`, and confirm generated `metadata.generatedBy` values
      are 1.13.1.
- [ ] Reopen Codex at the resulting repository root and verify `$openspec-*`
      autocomplete includes `$openspec-apply-change` before relying on the
      repository-local workflow.
- [ ] Replace the neutral `openspec/config.yaml` context with verified project
      constraints before planning the first substantial change.
- [ ] Keep `changes/` for active work and `specs/` for accepted specifications.
- [ ] Sync accepted delta specifications before archiving a completed change.

## 6. Prepare delivery

- [ ] Add CI and deployment only after their commands and target are known.
- [ ] Confirm the release versioning policy before keeping or documenting the
      baseline patch-only release workflow.
- [ ] Document the real release process, including versioning and deployment
      verification, in the README.
- [ ] Confirm that the README demo URL is live before replacing its placeholder.

## 7. Delivery gate

- [ ] Search for `project-name`, `{github-owner}`, `{repository-name}`,
      `{command}`, `{live-demo-url}`, `{demo_url}`,
      `github-repository-template`, `GitHub Repository Template`, and other
      template placeholder text; resolve or deliberately remove every
      remaining occurrence.
- [ ] Run every documented local setup, test, build, and formatting command.
      Run deployment or release verification only when authorized; otherwise
      state clearly whether it is intentionally not applicable or awaits user
      authorization.
- [ ] Verify that README links, screenshots, commands, packages, deployment
      instructions, and release instructions describe the resulting project,
      not this template.
- [ ] Verify the new repository's GitHub About description and topics match
      the finished project and its website URL is exactly
      `https://www.samuelasherrivello.com/`.

## 8. Ask about checklist cleanup

- [ ] After completing this checklist, ask the user explicitly whether they
      would like the AI to clean up this checklist.
