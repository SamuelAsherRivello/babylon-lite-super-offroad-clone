# RMC Game Creator

Turn one game request into a complete, tested, released browser game. Default to single player. Enable multiplayer when the user requests it, including explicit networked cooperative or competitive play. Carry the request through implementation and GitHub Pages delivery unless the user explicitly limits it to planning or local work.

## Arguments

Accept natural language or named fields; these are prompt inputs, not shell flags.

| Input | Required | Meaning and default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `game` | Yes | Core idea, player actions, and objective. Infer a small coherent game from a short idea; ask only if the idea itself is missing or materially contradictory. |
| `mode` | No | `single-player` (default) or `multiplayer`. Natural-language multiplayer requests also select multiplayer; resolve contradictory mode requirements before implementation. |
| `name` | No | Display name and/or repository slug. Derive omitted values from the idea; default slug `babylon-lite-<game-slug>`. |
| `art` | No | Visual direction, palette, mood, and supplied assets. Default to original, cohesive artwork suited to the mechanics. |
| `references` | No | URLs, files, or named games. Assign each a role (gameplay, art, layout) and intent (faithful or inspiration). Infer obvious roles and record them; resolve consequential conflicts. |
| `requirements` | No | Must-haves, exclusions, and overrides such as camera, aspect ratio, controls, repository owner, destination, or delivery scope. Explicit requirements override defaults. |

Default GitHub owner: `SamuelAsherRivello`. Use the authenticated account's existing access; never assume an unavailable credential. A name collision is not permission to replace an existing repository. Reuse it only when the user requests continuation of that project.

## Reusable prompt

```text
$rmc-game-creator
game: A one-screen arcade game where a robot redirects falling sparks into matching batteries before they overflow.
name: Spark Sorter
art: Chunky toy-like machinery, dark navy metal, warm orange sparks, readable silhouettes.
references: None; create an original design.
requirements: A 90-second score challenge with keyboard and touch controls.
```

For any invocation, apply this delivery brief to the supplied inputs:

> Create a complete game from `game`, using single player unless multiplayer is requested. For multiplayer, extend, test, release, and verify the shared Colyseus server for this game before creating the game client. Use `mode`, `name`, `art`, `references`, and `requirements` to refine it. Start from the required repository template, import the shared skills library, and use Babylon Lite with WebGPU. Plan and track the work with OpenSpec. Implement the playable loop, original presentation, desktop and touch controls, and recovery states. Test the game and inspect it in a real browser. Document it, release it through GitHub Actions, deploy it to GitHub Pages, verify the public build, and synchronize the local checkout. Return the playable URL, repository, release, verification results, and any remaining limitations.

## Required sources

- Template: https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/github-repository-template
- Shared skills: https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/ai-skills-library
- Multiplayer server (multiplayer only): https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/rmc-colyseus-multiplayer-server
- README presentation reference: https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/babylon-lite-pixel-walker (original prompt presentation, not inherited gameplay).

Use both repositories on every new project. Read their current instructions and actual default branches; do not assume the branches match. Create the game repository using GitHub's template-generation flow, then work in its local checkout. Read the resulting `AGENTS.md` and template usage checklist before changing project files.

Import the library's `.agents/skills` into the game's `.agents/skills` as real files. Inspect overlaps with bundled template skills and preserve local customizations; do not silently overwrite conflicting instructions or hand-edit generated skills. Use current library instructions and compatible OpenSpec tooling, resolving any material version conflict before continuing. Record the source revisions used. Do not update unrelated global skills as a side effect of creating a game.

Keep the template's application layout, corner UI roles, repository links, and version conventions unless the request or stack requires a documented change. Inspect package scripts, workflow files, and current Babylon Lite documentation/source before choosing commands or APIs. Use Babylon Lite specifically; do not silently substitute the full Babylon.js distribution or a different renderer.

## Define the game

Translate the inputs into a short design and concrete acceptance criteria: player actions, camera, objective, scoring/progression, failure or completion, restart, and visual direction. Separate mandatory mechanics from aesthetic references. Do not inherit contradictory mechanics or camera requirements from unrelated example prompts.

Defaults, unless overridden:

- Single player. Record the selected mode in the design and README. Single-player games need no Colyseus dependency, server change, or server release. For multiplayer, read [the multiplayer workflow](references/multiplayer.md) before planning and follow it alongside the common template and delivery steps.
- One complete, replayable game loop with a clear objective. For an explicitly requested sandbox, prioritize its interactions and reset behavior instead of inventing a win condition.
- A 9:16 portrait play area that fits one screen, with responsive desktop and mobile presentation. Fit controls and instructions without covering the action or requiring scrolling to play.
- Original game visuals and coordinated border/gutter artwork for space outside the play area. Follow a reference's rules when requested while giving the project its own assets and identity.
- Keyboard and on-screen touch controls matched to the mechanics. Support concurrent touch actions where needed, visible control feedback, and safe input release after focus loss or pointer cancellation.
- Clear instructions, pause/resume, restart, and recovery from failure. Show a useful unsupported-WebGPU or initialization-error message rather than a blank canvas.

## OpenSpec workflow

Use the imported OpenSpec skills for a practical sequence: explore when needed, propose, apply, verify, sync, then archive. Keep one named change through the sequence; resume a suitable existing change instead of creating duplicates. Read the selected skill and the project's current OpenSpec context, schema, and instructions before each stage. Confirm the resolved project/store root before writing; do not create an OpenSpec root as a side effect. If initialization is needed, follow the imported workflow's setup guidance.

1. **Explore — `openspec-explore`:** Use read-only investigation when mechanics, technical feasibility, or multiplayer contracts remain uncertain. For Spark Sorter, compare spark movement and collision rules, scoring, and touch controls against the template's capabilities. Resolve consequential questions and record reasonable assumptions in the subsequent proposal. Skip exploration when the brief is already clear. Exploration does not implement game code.
2. **Propose — `openspec-propose`:** Create the schema's proposal, design, delta specs, and tasks for a named change such as `add-spark-sorter`. Define observable acceptance criteria: redirect a spark, award points for a matching battery, handle overflow, finish the round, and restart with keyboard and touch controls. Include asset, browser verification, documentation, release, and public deployment tasks when those are in scope. Present the planning artifacts before moving to implementation.
3. **Apply — `openspec-apply-change`:** Implement that named change using its tasks and current instructions. Update planning artifacts when discoveries alter the design; return to read-only exploration for unresolved decisions. Mark a task complete only after its acceptance criteria are met. A full `rmc-game-creator` invocation authorizes this composite planning-through-delivery sequence, so continue from the presented proposal to apply unless the user requested planning only. A standalone explore or propose request retains its own planning boundary and does not authorize implementation.
4. **Verify:** Run the checks and actual browser gameplay described below. Complete in-scope release and public verification tasks before finalization. Leave failed or unavailable checks explicitly unverified and their tasks open; do not archive unfinished work to make delivery appear complete.
5. **Sync — `openspec-sync-specs`:** After implementation and verification match the agreed requirements, merge the change's delta specs into the main specs. Preserve unrelated requirements and inspect the resulting diff. For example, the round duration, scoring, overflow, and restart scenarios become maintained game requirements. Verify every delta is reflected in the main specs; if the schema has no delta specs, report sync as not applicable.
6. **Archive — `openspec-archive-change`:** Check artifact and task completion and the verified sync state, then archive the same named change using the imported workflow. Sync must finish before archive moves the change. Resolve blockers instead of bypassing incomplete-task or unsynced-spec checks. Include the synchronized specs and archive in the scoped delivery commit/push, and recheck local/remote alignment. Report the change name, sync result, and archive location.

For multiplayer, track server and client changes in their respective OpenSpec roots, link their protocol and release dependencies, and finalize each only after its own acceptance criteria pass. Planning-only work ends after proposal; local-only work omits external delivery tasks and can sync/archive after local acceptance criteria pass. Full game delivery includes sync and archive within the authorized scope; preserve any narrower user instructions.

## Build and verify

Keep game rules testable independently of rendering and input where practical. Choose an appropriately small implementation; avoid extra systems that do not support the requested loop. Ensure initialization, resize, pause, restart, and teardown do not duplicate loops or leave stuck input.

Use supplied assets when appropriate. Create the required original raster artwork with an available image-generation skill/tool when that fits the visual direction; use procedural or code-native art when appropriate. Integrate the actual assets and record their provenance. Do not leave placeholder artwork or imply that ungenerated assets exist.

Run the repository's applicable checks, gameplay tests, and production build. Cover meaningful rules and transitions such as scoring, victory/failure, restart, and any mechanic-specific edge cases. Do not treat a successful build as proof of playability.

Use a real browser with WebGPU to play a meaningful full loop. Exercise keyboard and touch/pointer behavior, pause/resume, failure/completion, and replay. Inspect representative desktop and narrow mobile layouts, console/runtime errors, asset loading, and screenshots. If touch hardware is unavailable, distinguish emulated input from physical-device verification. Capture evidence from the actual game, not a mockup. If WebGPU or browser automation is unavailable, report the limitation and keep the relevant acceptance criteria unverified.

Document setup, controls, gameplay, supported browser requirements, screenshots, asset sources, and known limits. In the root README, include an "Original AI Prompt" section using a collapsible details block and fenced text, following Pixel Walker's presentation. Preserve the actual game request, including supplied fields and consequential follow-up requirements; label follow-ups separately. Keep interpreted assumptions outside the quoted prompt, and do not present an invented or expanded brief as the original prompt. Redact credentials or private information before publication. Preserve useful template credits. Include timing or model metadata only when actually recorded.

## Release and deliver

Finish the template's delivery checklist. Verify that production asset paths work under the repository's GitHub Pages subpath. Keep version data consistent with the template's source of truth.

Inspect and use the checked-in GitHub Actions release and Pages workflows. Adapt missing game-specific build/deployment wiring during implementation before invoking a release skill that expects working infrastructure. Commit and push only task-related changes in the game repository and, for multiplayer, the shared server repository; preserve unrelated work. Do not open a pull request unless requested.

Run the release workflow, inspect its result, and verify the release/tag. If a release bot commit does not trigger Pages, explicitly dispatch the existing Pages workflow for the intended revision. Wait for deployment and check the actual public URL: game starts, assets resolve, controls work, and the displayed version matches the release. Do not equate a green deployment job with successful public gameplay verification.

Fetch and fast-forward the local checkout to include any release-generated version commit without discarding local changes. Recheck Git status and local/remote revision alignment. If authentication, permissions, workflow failure, or a conflicting remote update blocks delivery, preserve completed work and report the specific unfinished step; do not force-push or claim it is published.

Return concise links to the playable game, repository, and release, plus the local checkout path. Summarize completed checks and any unverified behavior or blockers. State the OpenSpec change name, verification status, sync result, and archive location, or the specific unfinished finalization step.
