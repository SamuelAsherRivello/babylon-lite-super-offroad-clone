# AI Repository Guidance

## Template use workflow

If user directs you to use this template, then follow these steps:

1. Determine the reuse mode from the request. For a new GitHub repository,
   use GitHub's **Use this template** flow when authorized. For a local project,
   create an authorized copy in its explicitly named destination. When the user
   says to use this repository only as inspiration, inspect it as a reference
   and copy no files unless they request that.
2. Read this file, then read
   `AGENTS_TEMPLATE_USAGE_CHECKLIST.md` before adding a stack or changing
   project files.
3. Confirm the project's purpose, target platforms, selected stack, deployment
   target, dependency policy, and whether an OpenSpec workflow is required. Ask
   only for an input that is material and not provided or discoverable.
4. Keep `project-name/` as the Vite application root and keep the GitHub
   repository URL synchronized with the project repository. The repository root
   remains the npm project root.
5. Inspect the resulting project's actual configuration before documenting or
   running setup, test, build, deployment, or release commands. Complete the
   checklist's delivery gate before presenting the project as ready.

## HTML template corner roles

The default HTML template uses four reusable `corner` instances inside
`ui_layer`. Preserve these roles when adapting the template:

- Upper left: project title.
- Upper right: project links.
- Lower right: project version.
- Lower left: project settings.

## Pull request workflow

- Do not create pull requests for any workflow unless the user explicitly asks
  for a pull request in the current request.
- Pushing a branch, committing changes, or completing an OpenSpec/template
  workflow is not implicit approval to open a pull request.

## Working directories

- **Repository root** is the npm project root. It contains `.git`, repository
  metadata, and package configuration. Project documentation assets live in
  `project-name/documentation/`. Run Git,
  dependency, build, test, and run commands there.
- **Application root** is `project-name/`. It contains the Vite entry page,
  source, tests, assets, and build output. Keep application implementation
  there unless the selected stack deliberately changes the layout.

Correct: run `git status`, dependency, build, test, and run commands from the
repository root; keep the application's source and tests under
`project-name/`.

## OpenSpec skill discovery

- Codex uses repository-local OpenSpec skills from `.agents/skills/`. Invoke
  them with `$openspec-*`; slash commands such as `/opsx...` are not Codex
  skill names.
- This template preserves `.agents/skills/.openspec-target` but does not bundle skills. Generate repository-local skills in the resulting project when its OpenSpec workflow is required.
- Verify `openspec --version` reports 1.13.1 and run `openspec doctor --json`
  from the repository root. If the CLI is missing or a different version,
  install `@fission-ai/openspec@1.13.1` using the official installation guide.
- Confirm each generated skill folder matches its `name:` frontmatter and each
  `metadata.generatedBy` value is 1.13.1. Do not hand-edit generated OpenSpec
  skill files.
- Reopen Codex at the resulting repository root after skills are generated or
  refreshed so repository-local `$openspec-*` autocomplete is indexed for the
  new workspace.
